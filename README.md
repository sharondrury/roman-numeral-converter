# roman-numeral-converter
Number to roman letter convertor with front-end features. Using online tutorials and documention to deploy a working convertor from number to roman numeral with a funky front-end page.

# Lessons Learned
Gaining more confidence in deploying JS through HTML. The code looked great until I add <form> so some work does need to happen in CSS.

# Potential Future Changes
- I will definetly re-write the CSS in SASS - CSS is a little broken after implementing a <form> tag (to use with the 'reset' button) once I had written all the code.
  
- I would also be inclined to change the code completely inpracticing other JS features.
  
# Comments
Feel to change my code to work better, as a beginner I know the code is a little rough in places.
